            I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned <br> were current, if not more so,

            “ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a 
            transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up 
            for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. 
            The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing 
            the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”

            Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp <br> themselves. Getting guidance from <br> them and

            “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve <br> never written a line of code. I needed <br> some structure from 
            professionals <br> who can help me learn programming <br> step by step. I was encouraged to <br> enroll by a former 
            student of theirs <br> who can only say wonderful things <br> about the program. The entire <br> curriculum and staff 
            did not <br> disappoint. They were very hands-on <br> and I never had to wait long for <br> assistance. The agile team 
            project, in <br> particular, was outstanding. It took <br> my learning to the next level in a way <br> that no tutorial 
            could ever have. In <br> fact, I’ve often referred to it during <br> interviews as an example of my <br> developent 
            experience. It certainly <br> helped me land a job as a full-stack <br> developer after receiving multiple <br> offers. 
            100% recommend! ”
